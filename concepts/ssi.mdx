# Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a paradigm shift in digital identity management that gives individuals complete control over their personal data and digital credentials.

## What is SSI?

Traditional identity systems rely on centralized authorities (governments, corporations, platforms) to create, manage, and verify identities. In contrast, SSI empowers users to:

- **Own** their identity data
- **Control** who accesses their information
- **Store** credentials in their personal wallet
- **Share** only what's necessary through selective disclosure

<Info>
  Think of SSI like carrying a physical wallet with your ID cards, but digital, cryptographically secure, and under your complete control.
</Info>

## Core Principles

SSI is built on foundational principles that ensure user sovereignty:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Self-Ownership" icon="user">
    You own your identity data. No one can take it away, modify it, or deny you access.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Control" icon="sliders">
    You decide who sees what information and for how long. Revoke access anytime.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Portability" icon="box-open">
    Take your identity anywhere. Not locked into a single platform or provider.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Persistence" icon="clock">
    Your identity persists as long as you want it to, independent of any third party.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Minimization" icon="eye-slash">
    Share only the minimum information necessary. Prove facts without revealing data.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Protection" icon="shield">
    Cryptographic security protects your data from tampering and unauthorized access.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How SSI Works

SSI operates on a trust triangle between three key actors:

```mermaid
graph LR
    I[Issuer<br/>Issues Credentials] -->|Issues VC| H[Holder<br/>User/Wallet]
    H -->|Presents VP| V[Verifier<br/>Requests Proof]
    V -->|Trusts| I
    
    style I fill:#818CF8
    style H fill:#6366F1
    style V fill:#10B981
```

### The Three Actors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="building" title="Issuer">
    **Who:** Organizations that issue credentials (universities, governments, employers, etc.)
    
    **What they do:**
    - Create and sign verifiable credentials
    - Maintain schemas and templates
    - Manage credential lifecycle (issue, revoke)
    
    **Example:** A university issues a digital diploma to a graduate.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="wallet" title="Holder">
    **Who:** Individuals who own and manage their credentials
    
    **What they do:**
    - Store credentials in a digital wallet
    - Present credentials to verifiers
    - Control who accesses their data
    
    **Example:** A graduate stores their diploma in Sphyre ALV wallet.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="check-circle" title="Verifier">
    **Who:** Organizations that need to verify credentials (employers, service providers, etc.)
    
    **What they do:**
    - Request specific credentials or claims
    - Verify cryptographic proofs
    - Make decisions based on verified data
    
    **Example:** An employer verifies a candidate's degree before hiring.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## SSI vs Traditional Identity

| Aspect | Traditional Identity | Self-Sovereign Identity |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Control** | Centralized authority | Individual user |
| **Storage** | Company databases | User's wallet |
| **Privacy** | Full disclosure | Selective disclosure |
| **Verification** | Contact issuer | Cryptographic proof |
| **Portability** | Platform-locked | Universal |
| **Revocation** | Authority decides | User controls |
| **Security** | Honeypot risk | Distributed |

## Real-World Examples

<Steps>
  <Step title="Digital Driver's License">
    Government issues a verifiable digital driver's license. You store it in your wallet and show it during a traffic stop without revealing unnecessary information like your home address.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Educational Credentials">
    University issues your diploma as a verifiable credential. You can prove your degree to employers instantly without waiting for background checks.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Age Verification">
    Instead of showing your full ID, you use a zero-knowledge proof to prove you're over 21 at a bar without revealing your exact birthdate or address.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Professional Licenses">
    Medical board issues your license as a credential. Hospitals can verify your credentials instantly without calling the licensing board.
  </Step>
</Steps>
