## Common Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="id-card" title="Digital Identity Verification">
    Replace physical IDs with verifiable digital credentials. Institutions can issue digital IDs, driver's licenses, and other identity documents that users can store in their wallet and present when needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="graduation-cap" title="Educational Credentials">
    Universities and educational institutions can issue tamper-proof diplomas, certificates, and transcripts that students own and can share with employers or other institutions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="briefcase" title="Professional Certifications">
    Professional organizations can issue certifications and licenses that practitioners can present to clients or employers, with instant verification capabilities.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Access Control">
    Organizations can verify credentials for access control without storing personal data, using zero-knowledge proofs to validate eligibility without revealing unnecessary information.
