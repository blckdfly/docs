## Welcome

Fortro Engine exposes REST endpoints consumed by the ALV wallet, Issuer dashboard, and Verifier portal. This section summarizes the top-level concepts before diving into endpoint details.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Auth & DID" icon="key" href="/api-reference/authentication">

## Base URLs

```text
Production: https://api.sphyre.tech
Staging:    https://staging-api.sphyre.tech (if enabled)
```

All endpoints live under `/api/*`. For example, the health check resides at `GET https://api.sphyre.tech/api/health`.

## Authentication

Every request must include a JWT issued after the DID challenge/response flow:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
X-User-DID: did:alyra:...
```

Issuer flows may also require the `X-Issuer-DID` header. JWTs expire after `JWT_EXPIRATION` seconds (default 86400); refresh via `POST /api/auth/login`.

## Rate Limiting & Errors

- Standard rate limit: 120 requests/minute per DID (subject to change). Exceeding limits returns HTTP 429 with `Retry-After`.
- Errors follow the unified `AppError` schema:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Validation error: Missing template_id",
    "code": 400
  }
}
```

## Generating API Reference

1. Export the latest OpenAPI spec from the backend (e.g., `scripts/export_openapi.sh` once available).
2. Place the spec at `docs/api-reference/openapi.json` to power interactive playgrounds.
3. For custom MDX pages, follow the structure under `docs/api-reference/auth/*`.

<Note>
  Legacy sample files (Plant Store) were replaced. Ensure no references to unrelated sample endpoints remain.
